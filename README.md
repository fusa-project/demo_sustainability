# FuSA demo 

This repository contains a notebook called `demo.ipynb` that shows how to request predictions for an audio file using the [FuSA system](https://www.acusticauach.cl/fusa/). We provide additional scripts to visualize and interpret these predictions.

Please see https://fusa-project.github.io/demo_sustainability/ for a rendered version of this notebook.

This demo is associated with *Carrasco, Arenas, Huijse, et al. "Application of Deep-Learning to Enforce Environmental Noise Regulation in an Urban Setting," 2022*, a manuscript submitted to MDPI Sustainability.
